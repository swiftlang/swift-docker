## Project Structure and Information

This is a community supported initiative to provide high quality Swift Docker images for production use.

## Working Group

@harisamin, @swizzlr and @khalian form the core working group for development of the images. This working group is entirely ad hoc and subject to coup at any time from interested parties.

## Relation to `official-images`
This is the source repository for the official Docker image of Swift. We are necessarily conservative in what we add to this repo for that reason.
